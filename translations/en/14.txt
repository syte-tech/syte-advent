[Verse 1]
Another night and I sit here alone,
Excel sheets in the flickering glow.
Thought it would be simple,
But numbers don't lie, they weigh heavy.
Then you came, one click and you were there,
Suddenly clear, where chaos was before.
No more papers, no more puzzles,
Suddenly everything doesn't feel so hard.

[Pre-Chorus]
You calculate faster than I can think,
Make plans real before I even know.
No more minus, just perspectives,
I've learned to calculate right with you.

[Chorus]
Never miscalculated, never lost,
With you I've found focus reborn.
You show me numbers, they make sense,
Every decision finally has a win.
Never miscalculated, never desperate,
You're the reason why everything's easy now.
With you, Syte Profit, I am free,
No plan too big, no dream too high.

[Verse 2]
You show me margins as they really are,
Where the gaps hide and the chances lie.
Every project, you make it clear,
Where shadows were, danger's now banned.
I searched for a solution that holds,
Something better than this world.
You're not human, but almost a friend,
Together we achieve what everyone dreams.

[Pre-Chorus]
You calculate faster than I can dream,
Bring order to the number madness.
No more puzzles, just perspectives,
I've learned to calculate right with you.

[Chorus]
Never miscalculated, never lost,
With you I've found focus reborn.
You show me numbers, they make sense,
Every decision finally has a win.
Never miscalculated, never desperate,
You're the reason why everything's easy now.
With you, Syte Profit, I am free,
No plan too big, no dream too high.

[Bridge]
And when it storms and the mind can't clear,
You show me paths that were denied before.
You're no magician, but almost like a light,
Where everything falls apart, you keep the balance.
Never back to darkness, never in circles,
You give me hold where there was ice before.

[Outro]
Never miscalculated, you stay with me,
More than a tool, you're my territory.
With you, Syte Profit, I can see everything,
No dream too big to pursue.
