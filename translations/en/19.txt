[Hook]
This is my territory, Bremen Street four two,
Dangerous and real, brother, you won't hold a piece here.
I bark and mark, this is my door,
Bremen Street four two ‚Äì I control this territory!

[Part 1]
Yo, I'm Pauli, the boss in the office,
But the street stays wild, that's no faux pas, yo.
While yoga runs hard, I chill on the floor,
The foosball hot like the block, we keep raging.

The coffee machine pumps, gives the hustle flow,
But I stand at the door, when it bangs, there's a shot.
Here are the kids from the block, the foosball glows like the night,
Bremen Street four two, a place that does it all.

The architects plan, but I have the power,
I'm the guardian, the boss, who watches over everything.
Beware if the postman comes through the door,
Then the alarm goes off, this is my territory!

This is my territory, Bremen Street four two,
Dangerous and real, brother, you won't hold a piece here.
I bark and mark, this is my door,
Bremen Street four two ‚Äì I control this territory!

[Part 2]
Hardcore yoga starting, I observe the drill,
People bend, but I stay quiet.
In the shadow of codes, where visions thrive,
I'm the soul of the team, always right there.

The foosball like a cage, the kids fight hard,
But I chill in my spot, everything stays smart here.
Coffee smells good, but I stick to my food,
Got a deal with colleagues ‚Äì for a snack it gets better.

Bremen Street four two, my block, my place,
No room for weakness, there's no fort here.
Everyone knows my name, I hold the position,
Here I'm the boss, without pause, without turning.

This is my territory, Bremen Street four two,
Dangerous and real, brother, you won't hold a piece here.
I bark and mark, this is my door,
Bremen Street four two ‚Äì I control this territory!

[Bridge]
Pack at the start, we dominate the space,
Bremen Street four two, here lives the dream.
Architects, developers, but I'm the core,
Without me this would just be bare and distant.

Yoga, foosball, coffee ‚Äì it all belongs to me,
I set the pace, brother, feel my desire.
Everything runs smooth here, because I have the view,
Bremen Street four two, here lives the day.

[Outro]
This is my office, my block, my goal,
Between concrete and code the street stays the game.
Syte rules, but I hold the power,
Pauli at the top ‚Äì no laughing here. üêæ
