Pull Request, let's go, I push my feature so,
Code fits, works, feature flow, everything tight like abs and core,
Merge ready, showing skills in the repo,
Push it, Commit it, everything runs in the flow.

(Verse 1)
I come into the branch, hustling like a star,
Git status checked, everything clean, all clear.
Code is stable, no errors, perfect,
Syntax on point, I'm always correct.

Master locked, but feature can join,
I push innovation, code like a champ.
Lines are smooth, no gaps in the game,
Merge Conflict? Nope, everything's tame.

(Pre-Chorus)
I push, I pull, I make the code tight,
Review my flow, approve, it's alright.
Deploy to main, my style is unique,
I'm the boss, no bug at the peak.

(Verse 2)
Code Review, team gives me props,
Comments clean, no need for stops.
Efficiency high, I push and win,
Test cases green, I go all-in.

My code is sleek, my workflow a show,
Continuous Integration, let it glow.
I'm a star in the dev community,
With every commit I bring energy.

(Pre-Chorus)
I push, I pull, I make the code tight,
Review my flow, approve, it's alright.
Deploy to main, my style is unique,
I'm the boss, no bug at the peak.

(Bridge)
Feature Branch, I make it smooth like a pro,
Pipelines running, CI/CD on the go.
My devs know, I'm simply great,
No delay, 'cause I always have fun.

(Outro)
GitHub Gang, we make the plan,
Merge, Rebase, push it to the Main now.
Code polished, smooth like a flow,
Shirin style, abs and core!
