[Intro]
Hey! Let's move the body,
With Nick Class and Domingo, let's go!
Cha cha cha fitness, rhythm and flavor,
Get ready 'cause the action's starting.

[Verse 1]
Feel the rhythm in your feet,
The heart accelerates again.
The music leads you to dance,
And with us you won't want to stop.

One, two, three, cha cha cha!
Turn, jump, don't stop now.
Each step fills you with energy,
With this flow change your life.

[Chorus]
Cha cha cha fitness, let's enjoy,
Nick and Domingo will cheer you on.
Move your hips, feel the heat,
Dance with your soul, sweat with passion!

[Verse 2]
Breathe deep, stretch your arms,
To the beat we all take steps.
Laughter and dancing are the mission,
And your body fills with emotion.

One, two, three, cha cha cha!
No excuses, don't look back.
Raise the rhythm, feel the explosion,
Every day is a new lesson.

[Chorus]
Cha cha cha fitness, let's enjoy,
Nick and Domingo will cheer you on.
Move your hips, feel the heat,
Dance with your soul, sweat with passion!

[Bridge]
(Come on!)
Hands up! (Cha cha cha)
Make it felt on the floor! (Cha cha cha)
This isn't a show, it's a lifestyle!
Dance with us, make it fun.

[Final Chorus]
Cha cha cha fitness, the ideal rhythm,
With Nick and Domingo it has no rival.
Dance to the sky, feel the emotion,
We're one family, give it heart!

[Outro]
(The tuba and clarinets sound, cheerful rhythm)
Cha cha cha, cha cha cha,
Your energy will never stop.
With Nick Class and Domingo,
The party will continue. Cha cha cha!
