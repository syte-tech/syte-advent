[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey! Who's starting here?
DJ Malahorny, the business developer at the beach!
He makes deals at syte and rocks Ballermann,
With a cocktail in hand, he draws everyone in!

[Verse 1]
When the sun laughs over Mallorca,
DJ Malahorny's been awake for long.
Checking emails on the beach, laptop ready to go,
Business Development for syte – full of dynamics and guidance.
But when the bass pumps and the party rages,
He forgets KPIs, the concept gets praised.
His smartphone beeps, but he has no time,
'Cause the sangria pitcher's been ready for a while!

[Refrain]
DJ Malahorny – the king of Ballermann!
Between deals and beats he dances ahead.
At syte he does business, at Malle the sound,
He brings the mood, wet and wild and colorful!
DJ Malahorny, so casual and fine,
With business in his head and party in his legs!

[Verse 2]
The party crowd yells, shouts his name loud,
Syte gets the next deal – oh how familiar!
He shakes hands to the beat of the bass,
Takes the next drink, yeah, that's what he enjoys.
From networking king to party hero,
His charisma at the beach is countless.
With flip-flops on his feet, a grin on his face,
He builds syte's future – a true poem!

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh!) Well-rested strategy!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh!) Party energy!
(Oh-oh-oh-oh!) Balance of success and pleasure,
So DJ Malahorny keeps going – without frustration!

[Refrain – Repeat]
DJ Malahorny – the king of Ballermann!
Between deals and beats he dances ahead.
At syte he does business, at Malle the sound,
He brings the mood, wet and wild and colorful!
DJ Malahorny, so casual and fine,
With business in his head and party in his legs!

[Outro]
And when the sun slowly sets,
Syte's future continues to move forward.
DJ Malahorny lets the glasses clink,
Makes deals, makes party, lets everyone sing.
So the night ends in pure pleasure,
With DJ Malahorny
