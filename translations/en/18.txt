[Intro: Bass Drop building tension]
Graphics drivers, no time to wait,
Fat servers burning, with 360 cards.
Cores dancing, bits trembling,
Hyperloop system, let the data live!

[Build-Up: Bass increasing]
10, 9, 8 – everything's spinning,
Frames exploding, hey, get lost!
7 straight – screw the rules,
Binary Code, let the walls shake!

[Drop: Hardstyle Kick sets in]
Screw it, so intense and tight,
360 cores, all ready.
Calculate, feed, cereal with toothpaste,
Techno on the server, it gets even crazier!

[Breakdown: Melodic Synths]
"The CPU glows – and I'll tell you one thing:
More cores, more power, life is a rhyme!"
Cooling howls loud, like a siren scene,
Data whirls wild, break every limit!

[Build-Up 2: Even more intense]
10, 9, 8, 6 – we're in it,
Fat machines, Ready to Fly!
Data packets – lightning fast,
In techno beat, every frame wins!

[Drop 2: Hardstyle Explosion]
360 cores, Hardcore mode,
All racing, bits in over-load.
Voltage boiling, air electric,
Server party runs, unforgettably epic!

[Outro: Flowing Energy]
From all holes: Power and beats,
Server hardstyle, no going back, no "Wait".
Graphics drivers through – everything flowing,
Hardstyle techno – a data pleasure.

[Finale: BPM high]
Screw it, 360, everything runs hot,
In this rave only hardcore is nice.
Servers dancing, techno burning,
This is the sound that everyone knows
