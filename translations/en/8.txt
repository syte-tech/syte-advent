(Verse 1)
In the meeting room it's heating up, the air is full of ideas,
We play our game, it's all about understanding.
Business Development, we're building the vision,
Turning dreams into actions, that's our mission.

Sales holds the reins, seduces with every pitch,
Closes the deal in a rush, that's how it runs in the light.
Marketing throws sparks, ignites the brand,
SYTE stands for class, unites every hand.

(Chorus)
BDSM – at SYTE we unite,
Business, Sales, Marketing, we stay pure.
Creating together, we push the dream,
Our fire burns bright, from here to every room.

(Verse 2)
Business thinks big, sees the plan,
Analyzes markets, pulls the first tooth.
Sales is the voice that moves hearts,
Every word a hit, every deal excites.

Marketing is magic, enchants with shine,
The message dances, every customer in trance.
Together we are strong, an inseparable team,
BDSM at SYTE, that is our dream.

(Chorus)
BDSM – at SYTE we unite,
Business, Sales, Marketing, we stay pure.
Creating together, we push the dream,
Our fire burns bright, from here to every room.

(Bridge)
SYTE is more than just a name, it is our heart,
Here flows the passion, in every sentence and verse.
BDSM drives us on, like a strong current,
We build our future, in our own domain.

(Outro)
BDSM – that's our thing,
Business, Sales, Marketing, a SYTE swing.
We stand together, grow every day,
With passion and focus, because each of us loves it.

(End)
