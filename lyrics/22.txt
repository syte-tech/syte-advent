(Verse 1)
Wakes up at 8, coffee’s on the line,
Power suit prepped, yeah, she’s lookin’ divine.
Laptop open, inbox alive,
Messages poppin’, she’s ready to thrive.

Her fingers fly like a disco queen,
Calendar chaos? She keeps it clean.
Printer’s jammed – that’s a minor scene,
She saves the day, sleek, fast, and unseen.

(Pre-Chorus)
Sippin’ black coffee, heart full of style,
Notes in her hand, she’s been workin’ awhile.
With every call, there’s a little bit of sass,
Handling meetings – she’s got the class.

(Chorus)
She’s the queen of the Office Pony Club,
Emails flash, she’s the heartbeat, the hub.
Sticky notes and sleek high heels,
Every task’s done – she’s the real, real deal.
She’s the queen of the Office Pony Club,
Tappin’ her nails, givin’ time the shove.
Syte’s best friend with a boss-babe glow,
She’s got the office in her control.

(Verse 2)
Fluorescent lights and a phone that rings,
Zoom call glam – she’s still wearing bling.
To-do list long but her patience sings,
Snack drawer ready for small work flings.

Bookings made with a perfect bow,
She’s got every flight, every chart in tow.
“Did you send that?” She’s like “You should know.”
The queen of schedules, she steals the show.

(Pre-Chorus)
Slides into the conference, fierce like a star,
Handling clients like a PR czar.
Reports so crisp they belong in a frame,
She’s got the groove in this admin game.

(Chorus)
She’s the queen of the Office Pony Club,
Emails flash, she’s the heartbeat, the hub.
Sticky notes and sleek high heels,
Every task’s done – she’s the real, real deal.
She’s the queen of the Office Pony Club,
Tappin’ her nails, givin’ time the shove.
Syte’s best friend with a boss-babe glow,
She’s got the office in her control.

(Bridge)
Monday blues? She don’t feel ‘em.
Chaos brewin’? She can seal ‘em.
Post-it crown and a desk so fly,
“Need a hero?” She’ll reply.
Ohhh, she’s got the Syte rhythm,
Everything’s smooth with a little precision.
Glitter pen queen of our corporate dream,
She’s the vibe, the energy stream.

(Breakdown)
Clap, clap – for the queen of the spreadsheets,
Snap, snap – deadlines fold at her feet.
All the hustle? She makes it look chic,
Syte’s secret sauce, week after week.

(Chorus)
She’s the queen of the Office Pony Club,
Emails flash, she’s the heartbeat, the hub.
Sticky notes and sleek high heels,
Every task’s done – she’s the real, real deal.
She’s the queen of the Office Pony Club,
Tappin’ her nails, givin’ time the shove.
Syte’s best friend with a boss-babe glow,
She’s got the office in her control.

(Outro)
Pink pens, blue screens, and a midday cheer,
She’s the one keepin’ everything clear.
Queen of the Syte, with a smile that shines,
Management magic, makin’ us all align.
