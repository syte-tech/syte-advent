[Verse 1]
Data flows, old and slow, time to break free,
We’re building pipelines for the future—dbt.
Transformations blazing, modern and fast,
Data at warp speed, leave the past.

[Chorus]
dbt, set the pace, ignite the flow,
Transform the streams, watch them glow.
dbt, modern tools, we’re leading the race,
Warp-speed data, the future’s place.

[Drop]
(Spacey techno beat with rising synths and heavy bass)
dbt—warp the speed,
Transform data, meet the need.
dbt—fast and clean,
Data flows like a dream.

[Verse 2]
SQL models stacking, modular and clear,
Version-controlled pipelines, the future’s here.
No more waiting, no more lag,
Real-time insights, we’re in the bag.

[Chorus]
dbt, set the pace, ignite the flow,
Transform the streams, watch them glow.
dbt, modern tools, we’re leading the race,
Warp-speed data, the future’s place.

[Bridge]
Code it once, watch it scale,
dbt makes pipelines prevail.
From staging to production, no time to lose,
Data pipelines we proudly cruise.

[Outro/Drop]
(High-energy climax, robotic vocal effects)
dbt—cutting edge, blazing the trail,
Transform the data, never derail.
dbt—future’s here, no need to wait,
Data pipelines, innovate!
