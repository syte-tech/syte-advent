[Intro]
CPU, GPU, API, we code it up, we aim sky-high.
HTTP, FTP, IoT, tech team’s here, that’s our ID.

[Verse 1]
We roll with AI, ML, NLP,
Debugging through the night, writing clean MVP.
CI/CD, deploy on the fly,
From SQL to JSON, watch the data comply.

JS, HTML, CSS flow,
In the stack with Docker, we make it glow.
VR, AR, XR in sight,
The tech team’s got the vision, future’s looking bright.

[Chorus]
We’re the MVP of the IT scene,
From APIs to UX, we keep it clean.
With SaaS, PaaS, and a bit of DevOps,
Tech team’s on top, never gonna stop!

[Verse 2]
KPI, OKR, goals aligned,
With Scrum and Kanban, we optimize time.
RESTful APIs connect the dots,
Cloud-native apps, we’re scaling a lot.

From AWS to Azure, we orchestrate,
Kubernetes clusters keep the workflows straight.
Big data pipelines with Spark and Kafka,
Making magic happen, hakuna matata!

[Chorus]
We’re the MVP of the IT scene,
From APIs to UX, we keep it clean.
With SaaS, PaaS, and a bit of DevOps,
Tech team’s on top, never gonna stop!

[Bridge]
Bit by bit, byte by byte,
From IoT to Blockchain, we ignite.
HTTP or HTTPS,
Encryption’s our mantra, we secure success.

UI, UX, make the users smile,
With every commit, we’re worth the while.
QA, UAT, green lights flash,
The tech team delivers, dash by dash!

[Outro]
AI, ML, and the IoT,
We’re building the future, just wait and see.
Tech runs the world, and that’s no lie,
With the team at Syte, we touch the sky.

[Fade Out]
CPU, GPU, API…
Tech dreams soaring high.
