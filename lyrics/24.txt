It was a cold winter evening
When the numbers started to show
51 million properties
That's how we'd grow
Got the team all excited
Vision clear in our minds
Nine billion square meters
Of space we could find
The investors they gathered
Round the table that day
Five million euros strong
Believing we'd pave the way

[Chorus]
We built it piece by piece
Through every startup phase
26 dreamers now
Working through the maze
Property data flowing
206 percent more
This year has been magic
Like none seen before

[Verse 2]
Ten new faces joined us
Making dreams come true
Triple digit growth now
Breaking through and through
15 states are covered
On our platform bright
Making real estate data
Clear as Christmas night

[Chorus]
We fought for every lead
Through winter, spring and fall
Now syte is soaring high
Standing proud and tall
The future's looking bright now
Twenty-twenty-five
This startup fairytale
Is keeping hope alive

[Bridge]
From humble beginnings
To this special year
Our team kept believing
The vision was clear
Property by property
State by state we grew
This fairytale's still writing
Its pages fresh and new

[Final Chorus]
We built it day by day
Through every startup phase
26 strong together
Leading through the maze
Property data flowing
More than ever before
This startup fairytale
Will keep on growing more
