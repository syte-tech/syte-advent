Oh, I’ve been stuck in this dusty room,
With paper trails leadin’ to our doom.
Charts so tangled, they made me sigh,
Dreams of warmth but the winters lied.

I’m comin’ in with a clearer view,
AI smarts and a plan so true.
The struggle’s over, the path’s in sight,
We’ll bring the heat, make the future bright.

Years of fightin’ with no way out,
Plans so shaky, filled with doubt.

But now there’s hope, the time is near,
A brand-new way to make it clear.

ENERsyte’s rollin’ in like a train on the track,
Bringing heat to the people, takin’ the weight off our backs.
With AI smarts and a brand-new way,
We’ll make the future warmer every day.
Say goodbye to the struggle, hello to the light,
Thank the stars above for ENERsyte!

I used to wrestle with broken schemes,
Pipe dreams frozen, shattered dreams.
Fingers crossed, we’d hope and pray,
But progress froze like a winter’s day.

Now I’ve got the tools to ease the load,
Smart solutions to smooth the road.
Six months faster, we’re movin’ ahead,
No more delays, no more dread.

I remember nights so cold and long,
Feelin’ like everything was wrong.

But now it’s clear, we’re changin’ the tune,
Heating up hearts, we’re risin’ soon.

ENERsyte’s rollin’ in like a train on the track,
Bringing heat to the people, takin’ the weight off our backs.
With AI smarts and a brand-new way,
We’ll make the future warmer every day.
Say goodbye to the struggle, hello to the light,
Thank the stars above for ENERsyte!

I’ve seen the frost and felt the pain,
I’ll melt it down, bring the sun through the rain.
Old ways are gone, it’s time to believe,
Together now, we’ll help them achieve.

ENERsyte’s rollin’ in like a train on the track,
Bringing heat to the people, takin’ the weight off our backs.
With AI smarts and a brand-new way,
We’ll make the future warmer every day.
Say goodbye to the struggle, hello to the light,
Thank the stars above for ENERsyte!

From the past I’ve come, I see it now,
And together we’ll make it work somehow.
Building a future, bright and right,
Singing our thanks to ENERsyte tonight
